                In Minecraft, players explore an intentionally blocky, pixelated, procedurally-generated 3D world, and may
                discover and extract raw materials, craft tools, build structures or earthworks, and, depending on game
                mode, can fight computer-controlled foes, as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players
                in the same world.
    
                These modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain
                health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. In the Java Edition, players can modify
                the game with mods to create new gameplay mechanics, items, textures and assets.

                Enderman are melee, hostile mobs that are found within nearly all Minecraft biomes and doesn’t burn in the
                daylight but can be damaged by rain or water.
    
                Endermen were the first three-block-tall mob ever added to Minecraft. Endermen take less damage from fire
                and lava than they do from water. Endermen were the eleventh mob added to the game, and were added at the
                same time as jukeboxes and note blocks.

                    Both children and adults are easily captivated by the world of Minecraft. It’s like discovering a limitless
                    container of Lego blocks. The open sandbox format of this game makes absolutely anything possible. Avatars
                    can collect resources by punching trees and digging up dirt. Eventually, these resources can be used in
                    formulas to create other tools. Tools can start simple—hammers, axes, and shovels, but players gain enough
                    resources, they can build complex tools—circuits, trains, and even houses. MinecraftEdu, an academic
                    organization comprised of educators and programmers, recommends the game to teachers because it is “easily
                    adaptable to curriculum” with “sandbox play [that] allows for ANY kind of experience.”
        
                    Contrary to other video games that have strict rules and linear event progressions, Minecraft is an open
                    environment that doesn’t come built-in with structured quests. This means that youngsters can roam through
                    this world and explore without an urgent set of tasks. However, they are still challenged by loose survival
                    requirements, such as feeding their avatars, building shelter, or warding off enemies (giant spiders or
                    green “Creepers”). Children are free to make mistake and succeed in the world of Minecraft. Wired notes that
                    video games have the power to help players “overcome the fear of failure IRL”

                <p>
                    There’s no denying that Minecraft provides children with unprecedented opportunities for creativity. Some
                    will explore extensive cave systems underground while other players might build lavish houses. Or who knows?
                    Perhaps your child will reveal their architectural genius and create astonishing block cities and structures
                    inspired by rea/fictional locations.
