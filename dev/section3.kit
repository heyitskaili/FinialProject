            In Minecraft, players explore an intentionally blocky, pixelated, procedurally-generated 3D world, and may
            discover and extract raw materials, craft tools, build structures or earthworks, and, depending on game
            mode, can fight computer-controlled foes, as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players
            in the same world.

            These modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain
            health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. In the Java Edition, players can modify
            the game with mods to create new gameplay mechanics, items, textures and assets.
