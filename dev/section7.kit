            Both children and adults are easily captivated by the world of Minecraft. It’s like discovering a limitless
            container of Lego blocks. The open sandbox format of this game makes absolutely anything possible. Avatars
            can collect resources by punching trees and digging up dirt. Eventually, these resources can be used in
            formulas to create other tools. Tools can start simple—hammers, axes, and shovels, but players gain enough
            resources, they can build complex tools—circuits, trains, and even houses. MinecraftEdu, an academic
            organization comprised of educators and programmers, recommends the game to teachers because it is “easily
            adaptable to curriculum” with “sandbox play [that] allows for ANY kind of experience.”

            Contrary to other video games that have strict rules and linear event progressions, Minecraft is an open
            environment that doesn’t come built-in with structured quests. This means that youngsters can roam through
            this world and explore without an urgent set of tasks. However, they are still challenged by loose survival
            requirements, such as feeding their avatars, building shelter, or warding off enemies (giant spiders or
            green “Creepers”). Children are free to make mistake and succeed in the world of Minecraft. Wired notes that
            video games have the power to help players “overcome the fear of failure IRL”

            There’s no denying that Minecraft provides children with unprecedented opportunities for creativity. Some
            will explore extensive cave systems underground while other players might build lavish houses. Or who knows?
            Perhaps your child will reveal their architectural genius and create astonishing block cities and structures
            inspired by rea/fictional locations.
