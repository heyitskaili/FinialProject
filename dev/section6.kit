        <p>
            Enderman are melee, hostile mobs that are found within nearly all Minecraft biomes and doesnâ€™t burn in the
            daylight but can be damaged by rain or water.

            Endermen were the first three-block-tall mob ever added to Minecraft. Endermen take less damage from fire
            and lava than they do from water. Endermen were the eleventh mob added to the game, and were added at the
            same time as jukeboxes and note blocks.
